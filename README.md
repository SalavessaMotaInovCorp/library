## ** Database Structure**  

### **Books, Authors & Publishers**  
- **Authors:** `id`, `name`, `photo`  
- **Books:** `id`, `isbn`, `name`, `publisher_id`, `description`, `cover_image`, `price`  
- **Publishers:** `id`, `name`, `logo`  
- **Pivot Table:** `author_book` (for many-to-many relationships)  

### **Book Requests**  
- **Users can request books from the library.**  
- **Table Schema:**  
  - `id`, `user_id`, `book_id`  
  - `user_name`, `user_email`  
  - `request_date`, `due_date`, `return_date` (nullable)  
  - `is_returned` (boolean), `is_confirmed` (boolean)  
  - `confirmed_at` (timestamp, nullable)  
  - `status` (enum: `active`, `pending_return_confirm`, `returned`)  
  - `total_request_days` (integer, default: 1)

- `/books/export`  
- `/authors/export`  
- `/publishers/export`

## ** How It Works**  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Users search for books**  
   - **Regular users** can only search in the **local database**.  
   - **Admins** can search both **locally** and in the **Google Books API**.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Admins import books from the Google Books API**  
   - If a book is missing from the local database, an **admin** can request it from the **Google Books API** and import it.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Users view book details**  
   - Books contain detailed information, including **cover, authors, publisher, and description**.  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Preview books**  
   - If a preview is available via Google Books API, **logged-in users** can read a sample.  

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Users request books**  
   - Users can **request books from the library**, track their request status, and manage their borrowing history.  

6Ô∏è‚É£ **3D Rotating Carousel**  
   - A **3D rotating display** showcases the latest books added to the library dynamically.
